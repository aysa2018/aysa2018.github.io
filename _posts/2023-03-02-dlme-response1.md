# What is metadata?

What is metadata? Obviously, as the name suggests the name suggests that it has something to do with data. Some kind of data, perhaps? Let's check what *meta* and *data* individually mean.

**Meta**
: *(of something that is written or performed) referring to itself or to something of its own type* [^1]

**Data**
: *information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer* [^2]

Metadata is "data that provides information about other data",but ***not the content of the data***, such as the text of a message or the image itself. For example: the name of the author, published date, publisher, genre and format are a book’s metadata. But metadata can not include its content: poems, storyline or any sentence. In short, Metadata is a pointer. It points towards the content by providing many properties so that we can find that but does not include anything from that data. We also commonly use them in our daily life unknowingly. Yes, when you search “Top 10 action films 2023”, you are taking help of metadata. ‘Top 10’ **Rank**, ‘action’ **genre**, 2023 **Release date** are all the metadata of the film you’ll finally watch.Metadata is very commonly used in data management and other fields of computer science and information science.

# What is discoverability?

**Discoverability**
: *the quality of being easy to find on a website, using a search engine, etc.* [^3]

Yes, discoverability is how easily one content can be found on the internet or database. To increase the discoverability, metadata is widely used for example sometimes, contents are sorted according to some specific orders, alphabetically, most viewed or most popular, most recent etc.
