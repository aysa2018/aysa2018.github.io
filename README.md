## Introduction

Hello, everyone! I am Aysa Binte Masud and I am currently studying Computer Science at New York Univeristy Abu Dhabi. This website was used for submitting assignments for the class ***Introduction to Digital Humanities*** by **Professor David J. Wrisley** in my Freshamn spring semester (spring 2022). This template utilizes Jekyll, an open source static website generator. This course was heavily focused on hands-on learning.
